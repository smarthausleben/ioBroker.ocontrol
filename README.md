## *oControl adapter for ioBroker*

Adapter to get values from 'oControl' furance control device using by bluetooth serial port of the device.  

## Prerequisites on Linux

    Needs Bluetooth development packages to build

    apt-get install build-essential libbluetooth-dev


## oControl Hardware Device needs to be paired first in order to use the adapter!!!

    Pair oControl using the Raspberry Command Line

    1. on the Rasperry running ioBroker enter 'bluetoothctl' to open Bluetooth control

    2. At the [bluetooth]# prompt enter the following commands:
        discoverable on
        pairable on
        agent on
        default-agent
        scan on

    3. Wait for a message to appear showing the oControl has been found:
     ... Device 00:12:6F:34:6D:0F ...

    4. Type pair with the mac address of the oControl:
        pair 00:12:6F:34:6D:0F

        you should see: Attempting to pair with 00:12:6F:34:6D:0F
                        Request PIN code
    
    5. Enter the correct PIN code (see oControl Software Dokumentation)
        [agent] Enter PIN code: ***
        
    6. oControl paireing process should look similar to this            .
        [CHG] Device 00:12:6F:34:6D:0F UUIDs: 00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
        [CHG] Device 00:12:6F:34:6D:0F ServicesResolved: yes
        [CHG] Device 00:12:6F:34:6D:0F Paired: yes
        Pairing successful

    7. After successfull pairing your oControl hardware with the Raspberry, you can start the oControl adapter
